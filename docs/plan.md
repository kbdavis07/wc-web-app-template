# Native Web Component Web App Template

## Goals

1. Have a bare Mininmal Native Web App Template that can be used for 75% of use cases straight out of the box with as few external depencies as possible.
    
2. Not a replacement for Front End Frameworks or Libraries like Angular,React, or Vue, just an option to use before having the need to use Frameworks or Libraries.

3. Clone and Go, with Zero Configuration for 75% of use cases, for remaining 25% easy to update and customize with as few edits to TypeScript files as possible, should only be edits to CSS and HTML pages and that is it.

4. JSON data driven out of the box, Data and UI seperate
5. Have fewer external depencies and total size of all Front end Frameworks and Libraries
6. Non Technical Users can easily use, just clone, edit JSON data, HTML, and GO!
7. Have a Gallery of pre-built (HTML/CSS) Based Templates to use.


## What Are Native Web Components?

**Native Web Components** are a way to create custom, reusable building blocks for websites and web apps. Think of them like LEGO bricks for the web! Just like how LEGO bricks can be combined in different ways to build anything you imagine, web components allow developers to build custom parts that can be reused on different web pages.

### Why Are They Important?

Imagine you have a button that you want to look the same on every page of a website. Instead of designing this button from scratch each time, you can create a web component for it once and then use it anywhere. This saves time and ensures consistency.

### How Do They Work?

1. **Custom Elements**: These are like custom LEGO bricks. Developers can create new HTML tags that don't exist naturally, like `<my-special-button>`, and decide how it should look and behave.
  
2. **Shadow DOM**: Think of this as a secret compartment inside each LEGO brick. It helps keep the styles and scripts of a component isolated from the rest of the page, so everything works smoothly without unexpected changes.

3. **HTML Templates**: This is like a mold or a pattern. Developers can define a blueprint of what a web component should look like and then reuse it wherever they need.

### Real-Life Example

Consider a house with many windows. In traditional building, each window might be a little different, which can be inefficient and costly. But with web components, itâ€™s like having a perfect, ready-made window that fits anywhere you want. If you need to change something, you change it once, and it updates everywhere!

### Why Should You Care?

Even if you're not a developer, understanding web components can help you appreciate how modern websites are built to be more efficient, faster, and more maintainable. They make it easier for developers to create sites that look and function consistently, which means a better experience for you as a user.
